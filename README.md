<h1>Systems Integrations</h1>

This repository contains sample apps, scripts, and guidance for integrating ArcGIS with different systems.

**ArcGIS Platform**</br>
For many of the samples there is an ArcGIS Platform API Key required. You can create a free ArcGIS Developer Account at developers.arcgis.com. You can create an API Key using the developer dashboard. The developer account includes a generous free tier for some of the services and there is a pricing tab for more information about the cost of the services

**ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise**</br>
Some of the samples demonstrate integrating ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise with a system. You will need your own license for ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise to test these samples.

Please let us know if you have feedback, find issues, or have ideas. The team will be active on this repository.
