# Integrating Salesforce and ArcGIS

## The ArcGIS System

This repository contains sample apps, scripts, and guidance for integrating ArcGIS with Salesforce.

**ArcGIS Platform**</br>
For many of the samples there is an ArcGIS Platform API Key required. You can create a free ArcGIS Developer Account at developers.arcgis.com. You can create an API Key using the developer dashboard. The developer account includes a generous free tier for some of the services and there is a pricing tab for more information about the cost of the services

**ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise**</br>
Some of the samples demonstrate integrating ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise with a system. You will need your own license for ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise to test these samples.

## Salesforce

These samples assume a moderate degree of familiarity with Salesforce. Salesforce offers an introduction to Salesforce development on their Trailhead in the [Developer Beginner Trail](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/trails/force_com_dev_beginner), including a Trail specific to [getting started with VS Code](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quickstart-vscode-salesforce?trail_id=force_com_dev_beginner).
