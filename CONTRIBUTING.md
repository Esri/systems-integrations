Esri welcomes contributions from anyone and everyone. Please see our [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/esri/contributing).

### Before filing an issue

Please take a look at [previous issues](https://github.com/ArcGIS/systems-integrations/issues) that resolve common problems.

If you're just looking for help, you'll probably attract the most eyes if you post on [Esri Community](https://community.esri.com/t5/developers/ct-p/developers).

If you think you're encountering a new bug, please feel free to log an [issue](https://github.com/ArcGIS/systems-integrations/issues) and include the steps to reproduce the problem (and preferably a running sample).

**Please include the following in your issue:**
* Browser
* Browser version
* ArcGIS version
* Bundling tool (webpack, browserify, Require JS) if any

### Setting up a dev environment
The samples will have ArcGIS Platform, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Enterprise requirements that will be mentioned in the code. There will also be requirements for the system ArcGIS is integrating with.
